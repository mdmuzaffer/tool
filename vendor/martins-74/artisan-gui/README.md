# Installation

Execute the following command on **Composer** to start downloading and installing.

	composer require martins-74/artisan-gui:dev-master

Once Artisan GUI is installed, you need to register a Laravel service provider, in your config/app.php:

```php
    'providers' => [
		...
		Martins\ArtisanGUI\ArtisanGUIServiceProvider::class,
	]
```

Now we need to publish the configurations, we do this by executing:

	php artisan vendor:publish


The last thing to do is to edit the password in config/artisan-gui-configs.php file:

	'password' => "wellthisisthesafestpassword",

> **Tip:** Artisan GUI works when Laravel is in Debug Mode for security reasons so be sure that APP_DEBUG is set to true ("APP_DEBUG=true"), however you can change this depencie in config/artisan-gui-configs.php ('useLaravelDebug' => "no") to let you activate/disable Artisan GUI with other variable ('artisanGUISwitch' => "on") also set in the same file.
